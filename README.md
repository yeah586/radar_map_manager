**Radar Map Manager (RMM)** is a millimeter-wave radar visualization and data fusion integration built specifically for Home Assistant.

It is not just a floor plan card, but a **spatial perception engine**. RMM maps data from multiple scattered millimeter-wave radars in your home onto one or more floor plans, enabling whole-house human tracking, trajectory visualization, and precise coordinate-based automation.

> 🚀 **V1.1 Officially Released!** Massive performance and security upgrades! Introducing the **10Hz In-Memory WebSocket Bus** for zero database bloat, **ECDSA Zero-Trust Security**, and **Hardware-Level Zone** synchronization.

## ✨ Core Features

### 1. 🎯 WYSIWYG Visual Editor
Ditch the tedious YAML coordinate calculations! RMM provides an interactive frontend editor:
* **Config/View Modes**: Supports **Config Mode** and **Read-Only Mode**, allowing for both easy setup and clean display.
* **Auto Discovery**: Automatically scans and easily adds supported radar devices within the local network.
* **Multi-Map/Multi-Floor Support**: Manage multiple floors and locations easily with **`map_group`**, creating independent views for your home or office.
* **Flexible Radar Configuration**: Drag and drop radar positions directly on the floor plan. Supports rotation, scaling, and mirroring for one-stop management.
* **Automatic Positioning & Scaling**: With the **Freeze** function, you can visually locate a radar target relative to the floor plan to easily adjust the radar scaling—goodbye to blind guessing.
* **Mounting Styles**: Perfectly supports both **Side Mount** and **Ceiling Mount** radars.

### 2. 🌐 Multi-Radar Sensor Fusion
RMM's target fusion engine unifies target points from multiple radars into a single coordinate system:
* **Auto-Clustering**: Merges data when multiple radars detect the same person to prevent "ghost targets." Supports custom fusion ranges.
* **Blind Spot Compensation**: Eliminates detection dead zones in rooms by overlapping multiple radars.

### 3. 🛡️ Flexible Zone Management
Supports arbitrary polygons with flexible editing, making zone management easy:
* **Radar Monitor Zones**: Set individual monitor zones for each radar. Targets are only fused and displayed if they enter this zone; otherwise, global fusion is used by default.
* **Global Detect Zones**: **Automation Powerhouse!** Freely set detection zones on the floor plan. When a fused target enters these zones, HA entities (automatically generated) are triggered. You can also customize trigger delays to avoid false alarms.
* **Global Exclude Zones**: **The False Alarm Killer!** Draw zones around fans, curtains, or plants. The engine automatically filters out all interference signals within these areas.
* **Hardware-Level Zones (`Hardware Zones`)**: (Exclusive for RMM Exclusive Radars, upcoming) Draw polygons on the HA map and sync them directly to the radar's hardware for native signal filtering! This perfectly complements global zones.
* **Automation Entities**: Each Global Detect Zone automatically generates a **Presence entity (`binary_sensor`)** and a **Count entity (`sensor`)**, letting you easily implement automations. Easily implement automations like "Person on sofa automatically turns on TV" or "Person enters bathroom area automatically adjusts lights."

### 4. 📐 3D Spatial Correction
For side-mounted radars, RMM features a built-in 3D geometric correction algorithm. It automatically converts Slant Range to Ground Distance based on installation height and target height, significantly improving positioning accuracy.

## 🛠️ Supported Hardware

RMM is compatible with any millimeter-wave radar integrated into Home Assistant (including 1D, 2D, and 3D radars), as long as they provide `DISTANCE` or `X/Y` coordinate data, such as `HLK-LD2450` `LD2460` `LD6001` `LD6002b` `LD6004`

* **Connection Methods**:
    * RMM Exclusive Radars, upcoming
    * ESPHome / MQTT
    * Zigbee (Must support coordinate reporting)

* **Entity Naming Convention**
   * ‼️ IMPORTANT ‼️ To ensure the system correctly identifies radar data, please follow these naming formats:

   * **1D Radar**: `sensor.[radar_name]_distance`
     * *Example: `sensor.rd_ld2410_distance`*
   * **2D/3D Radar**: `sensor.[radar_name]_target_?_x`
     * *Must include: `_x`, `_y`, `_z` coordinates*
     * *Example: `sensor.rd_ld6004_target_1_x`*
   * **Radar Target Count [Optional]**: `sensor.[radar_name]_presence_target_count`
     * *Example: `sensor.rd_ld2450_presence_target_count`*
   * **Target Coordinate Units**:
     * *Supported units include: `m`, `cm`, `mm`*
     * *It is strongly recommended to set a unit. If no unit is set, `m` will be used by default.*

#### High-Frequency Entity Exclusion Configuration

**For V1.0.x Users: (Strongly Recommended)**
If you are using **RMM V1.0.x**, it is strongly recommended to add the following configuration to your HA `configuration.yaml` to reduce database and I/O pressure:

```yaml
recorder:
  exclude:
    entity_globs:
      - sensor.rmm_*_master
```

**For V1.1.x Users: No configuration needed**
If you have upgraded to **RMM V1.1.x**, you do not need to add the above configuration. V1.1 has completely optimized the underlying data flow; all high-frequency coordinate data is transmitted via an in-memory channel and is no longer written to the Home Assistant database.

### A. 📡 Radar Layout (Layout)

Click `Layout` in the panel to enter radar layout mode. Targets displayed here are raw radar coordinates.

![LAYOUT](images/layout_1.png)

#### 1. Add/Delete Radar

* Add: Click `+`, enter the radar name as defined in HA. For example, if the coordinate entity is `sensor.rd_ld2450_target_1_x`, enter: `rd_ld2450`

* Delete: Select an added radar and click `-` to delete it. Operate with caution.

#### 2. Radar Settings

![LAYOUT](gif/layout_editor.gif)

* Positioning: Drag the radar to its actual physical location on the map. Drag the radar handle to adjust the angle. Position and rotation can be fine-tuned using the `X`/`Y`/`Rot` inputs in the panel.

* Scale Adjustment: Stand within the radar's detection range (preferably away from the center line and try multiple positions). Use a combination of these methods to match radar targets with the floor plan:
  
  * 1（Recommended). Click the `Freeze` button. This locks the first target detected by the radar. Manually drag this target to your actual standing position on the floor plan, and the system will automatically calculate the scale.

![LAYOUT](gif/layout_freeze.gif)

  * 2. Adjust `ScX` and `ScY` sliders to change the `X`/`Y` coordinate scaling.
  * 3. Click `Ax` / `Ay` to automatically adjust based on the background image aspect ratio (reference only).
  

* Mounting Mode: Check `Ceiling` at the bottom of the panel to switch between "Side Mount" and "Ceiling Mount".

* Mirror Mode: Check `Mirror` to invert the radar's X-axis.

* 3D Correction: Check `3D` and input the radar installation `height` (in meters) to enable 3D geometric correction. If the radar height is within standard ranges, this may not be necessary.

* UNDO: Undo the last operation.

#### 3. Radar Monitor Zones

![LAYOUT](gif/layout_monitor.gif)

* Select a radar via the panel or the map, then click the `Monitor` button to edit its monitor zones.

* Add Zone: Click `ADD NEW`, define the shape by clicking polygon points on the map, name the zone, and click `FINISH` to save.

* Adjust Zone: Select a zone and drag points to adjust the shape. Double-click a point to delete it.

* Delete Zone: Select a zone and click `DEL` to remove it; click `CLR ALL` to remove all monitor zones for that radar (Caution!).

* Click `DONE` to exit Monitor zone editing.

### B. 🛡️ Zone Management (Zones)

Click `Zones` in the panel to enter global zone management. Note: Zones here are global and relate only to fused targets, not specific radars. Targets displayed here are fused coordinates (default gold color).

![ZONE](gif/zones_select.gif)

#### 1. Detect Trigger Zones

* Editing operations are the same as Monitor zones.

* Delay: Supports setting a target entry delay. Enter the delay time (in seconds) in the `Dly` box to prevent false alarms caused by transient anomalies.

* Automation: Once set, this automatically creates "Occupancy" and "Count" entities for automation.

![ZONE](images/rmm_sensors.png)


#### 2. Detect Exclude Zones

![ZONE](images/zones_exam_2.png)

* Editing operations are the same as Monitor zones.

* Fused targets falling into this zone will not be displayed or triggered. Use this to mask interference from fans, air conditioners, etc.

### C. ⚙️ Settings (Set)

Click `Set` in the panel for global parameters.

![SET](images/set_1.png)

* `Update`: Radar target refresh interval.

* `Merge`: Radar target fusion distance. Targets from different radars within this distance will be merged.

* `Tgt_H`: Target centroid height, used for 3D correction.

* `Color`: Custom color for fused targets.

* `Backup`: Backup current configuration and export to a file.

* `Restore`: Import a file to restore configuration.
